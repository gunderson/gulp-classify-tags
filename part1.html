Or was I the wrong guy in the right place?</span><span class="sentence"> From my point of view – <i>my</i> perception – I was the wrong guy in the wrong place, so it was no surprise that my troubles multiplied.</span><span class="sentence"> But this is all with the benefit of <a id="47">hindsight</a> and its 20/20 vision. At the time I thought my luck had changed.</span><span class="sentence"> At last, I thought, things are going my way.

    <p><span class="sentence"> <moment id="c1m04" delay="0">London.</moment> October.</span><span class="sentence"> Three days after my flat had been burgled and five days after my car had been sideswiped by a white van that didn't stop, my agent, Gervase <a data-id='48'>Somerville</a>, called.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Alec, darling boy, you’ve got an audition. An “American” movie, no less.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I tried not to let my excitement overwhelm me.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “What’s it called?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Ah…” Rustle of papers. “Um…Yes, <moment id="transfigured">Transfigured Night.</moment>” </span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Isn’t that a sextet by some composer?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Quite possibly. Anyway, it happens to be the title of this fillum.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> The script was embargoed, he said. I thought this a good sign.</span><span class="sentence"> And the producers were in final negotiation with an A-list director, he added, they would announce next week.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Where’s the meeting?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “The Metropole Grande, Mayfair. 10.30, Monday morning.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Any idea what this film’s about?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “A <moment id="c1m07" delay="0">'dystopian thriller'</moment> is all they told me.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> Story of my life, I thought.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’ll be there.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> Now, I have appeared in many films and I know the industry’s cruel and ruthless disappointments as well as anyone but, </span><span class="sentence"> despite my better judgement, I allowed myself a little frisson of pleasurable anticipation.</span><span class="sentence"> After all this bad luck – the burglary, the totalled car</span><span class="sentence">  – here was the world paying me back.</span><span class="sentence"> I liked dystopian thrillers –</span><span class="sentence"> I’d already had minor roles in at least two – and I sensed that something about my looks, my track record, word of mouth, had paid dividends this time.</span><span class="sentence"> I hadn’t <moment id="c1m08" delay="0">worked</moment> in three – no, five – months  and money was running very low and, despite my better judgement, I allowed myself to fantasize that I’d get this role.</span><span class="sentence"> What do they say? Earn your own luck.</span><span class="sentence"> I reckoned I’d earned it, all right.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> <SceneBreak></SceneBreak></span><span class="sentence"> The Metropole Grande was one of those smoked-glass eight-storey blocks just off Park Lane.</span><span class="sentence"> On entering, you left London and could have been in Singapore or Dubai, Tokyo or Acapulco.</span><span class="sentence"> Granite, marble, palm trees, chilled lounge-muzak, foreign staff in black, zipped jumpsuits and a curious transnational clientèle.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I was shown up to the conference suites on the third floor where a young woman called “Shirlee”, according to her name badge, asked me to wait in an anteroom.</span><span class="sentence"> “Is there a script I could read?” I enquired.</span><span class="sentence"> “I’m afraid the script is embargoed at this moment of speaking,” she said.</span><span class="sentence"> I handed over my resumé and she disappeared behind heavy teak doors.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I drank some water from the watercooler. I looked down at the traffic circling Hyde Park corner. </span><span class="sentence"> I switched my brain to neutral </span><span class="sentence"> – it’s work: don’t be picky, don’t be pretentious, I told myself. </span><span class="sentence"> Be nice to everyone.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> Shirlee opened the teak doors and ushered me in.</span><span class="sentence"> A thickset man, 40s, swarthy, unshaven, in a loose v-neck t-shirt and carefully distressed and torn jeans came round from behind a desk piled high with scripts and shook my hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Hi,” he said, introducing himself. “Ron Suitcase. There’s been a blunder. I’m so sorry.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “A blunder?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’m expecting a twenty-three-year-old young woman called Alexa Dunbar.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I felt like falling to the floor.</span><span class="sentence"> This had happened on three previous occasions.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I admit,” I said, “I am not a young woman.</span><span class="sentence"> But I am a thirty-five year old man called Alec Dunbar.</span><span class="sentence"> Any good?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Thereby lies the error,” Ron Suitcase said with a sad smile. “One vowel.</span><span class="sentence"> Coffee? Iced tea? Water?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I sat down and Shirlee brought <moment id="c1i1" delay="0">me</moment>  a double espresso as we commiserated.</span><span class="sentence"> Casting agents – you’d think they’d do their bloody homework.</span><span class="sentence"> Tell <moment id="c1m18" delay="0">me</moment> about it.</span><span class="sentence"> Nightmare.</span><span class="sentence"> Alec/Alexa Dunbar.</span><span class="sentence"> I recounted my Alec/Alexa anecdotes – the misdirected (obscene) fan mail; the twenty-five paparazzi waiting outside a restaurant for me to emerge and their collective rage; the phone calls offering me swimwear modelling work.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “One of you should make a change,” Ron suggested.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I was there first,“ I said. “Apparently her real name is Agatha Duguid.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “What can I say?” Ron rose to his feet  – the meeting was over.</span><span class="sentence"> “If there’s a part for you in <i>Transfigured Night</i>  I’ll call your agent. Stay in touch, Alec. Be well. Take great care.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> He handed me his card and I glanced at it: Ronaldo Sudkäsz, Alzacar Films.</span><span class="sentence"> There was an address on Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles.</span><span class="sentence"> I slipped it into my jacket pocket and we shook hands amiably – for the last time, I assumed.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> Shirlee showed me out and handed me back my resumé.</span><span class="sentence"> I was feeling that leaden sense of failure that we actors experience occasionally: a kind of existential certainty that somewhere early in our lives we had taken the wrong turning.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “How did it go?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I looked round.</span><span class="sentence"> A young woman sat there on a sofa, a script open on a coffee table in front of her. She had thick shaggy blonde hair and one of those long lean faces with a nicely prominent jaw.</span><span class="sentence"> I’m drawn to long lean faces with a nicely prominent jaw.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “A sex confusion,” I said.</span><span class="sentence"> “I’m meant to be a twenty-three-year-old woman called Alexa. </span><span class="sentence"> Alas, I’m not.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Didn’t they spot it instantly?” she said.</span><span class="sentence"> “I did.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I was <moment id="c1m29" delay="0">intrigued</moment> and sat down opposite her, stuffing my resumé into my rucksack.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “You’ve a script, at least,” I said. “Good role?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’ve got pages. I get to speak,” she said. “That’s a plus.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> For some reason I unburdened myself, telling her about the persistently annoying Alec/Alexa confusion, </span><span class="sentence"> my run of bad luck, how I was stupidly counting on this part in <i>Transfigured Night</i>  to put everything right and that I was now bracing myself for the next kick in the teeth.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> She listened sympathetically, not interrupting.</span><span class="sentence"> She had green eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Burgled as well,” she said. “Did you lose much?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Funnily enough, they only stole my clothes – my best clothes. </span><span class="sentence"> Strange selection. Three suits, an old leather jacket that I loved, a pair of new, unworn shoes, swimming trunks, t-shirts. I think they were going to steal my computer – someone had been fiddling with it – but I guess they were spooked and ran off.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Yes. What did Shakespeare say?</span><span class="sentence"> When sorrows come, they come not as single spies – “</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “— But in battalions. Yeah. </span><span class="sentence"> Tell me about it. </span><span class="sentence"> I’d better go,” I said. “Thanks for hearing me out. And good luck.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I stood, gave her my little brave soldier salute, and just as I turned away she said:</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “How would you like to earn £1000 in 24 hours?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I paused and then sat down again.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “That depends,” I said. “I charge more for a contract killing.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I need something hand-delivered, something precious. It has to be in Scotland tomorrow.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Can’t you courier it?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Too fragile.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Catch a plane?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “It would have to go in the hold. That’s impossible. It has to be driven north. Hand-delivered, as I said.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Why don’t you do it yourself?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> She eased her posture and drew her right leg out from under the coffee table. Her <moment id="c1m39" delay="0">ankle</moment> and lower leg were encased in a black plastic boot leg cast.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’ve broken my ankle.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Ah. I see,“ I said.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> We looked at each other.</span><span class="sentence"> I was definitely attracted to this pretty young blonde woman in the leg cast, but I tried not to let that affect my judgement.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Look, it was just a spontaneous idea,” she said. “Don’t worry. I’ll find someone else. Not a problem.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Cash?” I said.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “In advance,” she said.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> Shirlee appeared at the teak doors.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Miss Devereaux?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’ll be right there,” Miss Devereaux said, standing with some difficulty. I had a name. </span><span class="sentence"> She smiled at me. “Nice meeting you,” she said. “Good luck yourself.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’m in,” I said, quickly.</span><span class="sentence"> One thousand pounds, twenty-four hours. Maybe my luck was indeed on the turn.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Do you have a car?” she asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Ah. No. It’s off the road.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “OK. I can lend you mine.”</span><span class="sentence"> She glanced at Shirlee then lowered her voice.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Meet me at the Peace Pagoda in Battersea Park this evening at six o’clock. We’ll sort everything out.”</span><span class="sentence"> And with that she limped into the room for her audition with Ron Suitcase.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> <SceneBreak></SceneBreak></span><span class="sentence"> The <moment id="c1m44" delay="0">Peace Pagoda</moment> was constructed in Battersea Park in 1985.</span><span class="sentence"> When I first saw it, when I moved to London to go to drama school, I thought it a shocking affront, an act of vandalism.</span><span class="sentence"> An oriental temple in a stretch of landscaped Victorian urban greenery facing the select mansion flats of Chelsea across the River Thames.</span><span class="sentence"> How had it obtained planning permission? Who had been bribed?</span><span class="sentence"> But, over the years, I became used to it, and started to rather like it, and now as I stood there looking at it, set in its backdrop of autumnal plane trees, the river at high tide, I thought it was rather wonderfully inappropriate</span><span class="sentence"> – a symbol of London’s easy welcome to the polyglot, multicultural presences drawn to this great sprawling city. Bring it on – we can take it, the city seemed to say. Pagodas? Yeah, no problem.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I leant on the <moment id="c1m48" delay="0">embankment</moment> wall looking at a cormorant diving for fish.</span><span class="sentence"> It was twenty past six, and no sign of my actress and her thousand pounds.</span><span class="sentence"> Some kind of sick joke, I thought, another young woman messing with my head, another sign of my bad –</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Alec!”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I picked up my rucksack and headed towards Miss Devereaux. It was absurd that I didn’t know her first name.</span><span class="sentence"> She was standing in the car park to the east of the Pagoda, leaning against an old grey sun-bleached, weather-battered Land Rover Defender, long-wheelbase variety.</span><span class="sentence"> The <moment id="c1m52" delay="0">door</moment> on the driver’s side was a pale salmon pink.</span><span class="sentence"> On the door, still legible, was a faded black, stencilled codenumber: <moment id="c1m53" delay="0"><kt99>KT-99</kt99></moment>. Legacy of some trans-Sahara 4x4 rally, I assumed, or something.</span><span class="sentence"> This motor had had an interesting life, clearly.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> We shook hands.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “What’s your first name?” I asked. ”By the way.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Stella,” she said handing me the keys. “You’re insured to drive it, by the way, also.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Good. What am I delivering?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> She opened the rear door and took out a coolbox, unclipped the top and lifted out a thick glass flask about nine inches tall.</span><span class="sentence"> Its lid was sealed with rubber and held down by metal clamps, rather like a <i>bocale</i> of foie gras, I thought – airtight.</span><span class="sentence"> It contained a pint of clear fluid, I calculated.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “This is water from the River Jordan,” Stella Devereaux said.</span><span class="sentence"> “My godson is being christened tomorrow in Scotland and this is my gift to him and the family.</span><span class="sentence"> Holy water.</span><span class="sentence"> I’d have driven it there myself, but – “ she pointed to her plastic leg cast.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Where in Scotland?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “The west coast, south of Skye.”</span><span class="sentence"> She reached into the front seat and brought out a plastic envelope file. “A church, St. Mungo, in a small village called Alcorran.”</span><span class="sentence"> She showed me <moment id="c1m61" delay="0">maps,</moment> addresses, a slip of paper with her telephone number and email address on it.</span><span class="sentence"> “You’ve got everything there. But it’s a long drive,” she said.</span><span class="sentence"> “You’ll need to go all night.“</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “I’ve done it before,” I said, half lying.</span><span class="sentence"> I’d endured a three-day, non-stop ‘drive’ across the USA in a film called <moment id="beyondtheedge" delay="0">Beyond the Edge</moment> (2007) so I vaguely knew what was required to keep you going.</span><span class="sentence"> “No worries.”  I said, </span><span class="sentence"> smiling reassuringly at her – she was really rather attractive; such thick, unruly hair…</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Did you get the part?” I asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “What part?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “<i>Transfigured Night.</i>”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Oh. They’re calling me back,” she said.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Bravo,” I said. “When are they shooting?”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Ah… Later this year.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “We’re already in October.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Or early next year.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Well, your ankle will be fixed, at least.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “Yeah. Of course.”</span><span class="sentence"> She smiled and rummaged in her pocket, taking out a crumpled envelope and handing it over.</span><span class="sentence"> I glanced inside. A <moment id="c1m66" delay="0">wedge</moment> of £50 notes, twenty of them.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “You’re very trusting,” I said.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> “You’ve a trustworthy face.” She leant forward and kissed me on the cheek.</span><span class="sentence"> “Bon voyage, Alec Dunbar.”</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> She <moment id="c1m68" delay="0">limped</moment> off into the dusk, heading for the gate on Chelsea Bridge Road.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> <SceneBreak></SceneBreak></span><span class="sentence"> I sat in KT-99, familiarising myself.</span><span class="sentence"> I’d driven a Land Rover Defender in <moment id="deltafiveniner">Delta Five Niner</moment>, an SAS, behind-enemy-lines film (I played a sergeant) that was never released, not even as a DVD. “Straight to radio,” as we say in the business, </span><span class="sentence"> but at least I felt at <moment id="c1m71" delay="0">home</moment> behind this wide wheel and dashboard.</span><span class="sentence"> I eased the seat back from Stella’s cramped driving <moment id="c1m72" delay="0">position</moment> (I’m six feet two) and looked at the many maps of Scotland she had given me.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> London to Glasgow, then the A82 up the west side of Loch Lomond. To Arrochar and Loch Fyne and on to Inverary. Then Loch Awe and on up to Oban, Fort William – and <moment id="c1m73" delay="0">there</moment> was Alcorran, south of Mallaig, right on the coast across the sound from the southern tip of Skye…</span><span class="sentence"> I should be there by noon, all being well. That gave me eighteen hours, all told.</span><span class="sentence"> If I made good going I could even have a nap on the way.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> I felt strangely excited: this was an adventure, out of the blue. A beautiful woman had offered me this bizarre opportunity – and a lot of money for one day’s work.</span><span class="sentence"> This was what life was all about, I told <moment id="c1m77" delay="0">myself</moment> – to be lived to the full, come what may. Happenstance. The roll of the dice.</span><span class="sentence"> I had £1000 in my pocket and I was sitting at the wheel of a Land Rover <moment id="c1m78" delay="0">Defender</moment> in Battersea Park ready to drive through the night to deliver holy water to a small church on the west coast of Scotland.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sentence"> Route determined, I searched my rucksack for my iPod. Every type of driving music was available to me.</span><span class="sentence"> All I needed now was an overdose of caffeine. I started the engine, revved it, flexed my shoulders.</span><span class="sentence"> Off we jolly well go, I said to myself, and pulled out of the car park, onto Chelsea Bridge Road, crossed the <moment id="c1m79" delay="0">river</moment> and headed for Marble Arch and the north.</span>
